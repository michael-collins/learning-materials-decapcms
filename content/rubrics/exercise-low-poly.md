  Demonstration: Low Poly Animal

  This week I want you to make a low poly animal. Ideally, you will have more
  than one reference image.


  Below is a demonstration of how I would approach resolving a low poly model
  with only a profile image. 


  For your assignment I encourage you to work from multiple reference images
  instead. However, some of the techniques I use to calculate volume and resolve
  topological flow may be of help.


  There is an additional video in the playlist that demonstrates the use of
  particles as a means of generating feathers on my Ostrich.

## Grading Criteria

### Steps completed

This criteria assess whether you completed all parts of a given set of instructions.

### Attention to detail

This criteria measures ability to use proper naming conventions and formats, meet submission deadlines, check to see that others are able to access submitted materials, and fulfills other specified requirements.

### On time

This criterion checks to see if the assigned task was submitted on time. This indirectly assesses time management.
