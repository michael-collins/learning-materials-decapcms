## Learning Objectives

1. Practice configuring render settings to create a high quality render in Blender.
2. Apply appropriate lighting strategies to light the room

## Instructions

1. Watch the tutorials in Learning Resources.
2. Duplicate the modeling folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
3. Configure materials and lights to achieve the desired lighting style.
4. Enable and configure the camera's **depth of field** settings
5. Render settings using **Cycles**
    1. Hi-res image render: 3840×2160
    2. Render sample settings: 500
    3. Denoise enabled
6. Save the image as `room-render.png`, etc. in the project folder. One render of each object is all that is required.
7. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `LASTNAME-room-render.zip`**.**
8. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
9. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your `.zip` file can be downloaded and opened.
