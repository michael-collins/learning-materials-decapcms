In this exercise, you will practice unwrapping UVs, exporting a UV map, and creating textures in 2D image editing software like Photoshop. You will then apply your textures to a polygonal model of the KEM Weber Airline Chair.

## Learning Objectives

1. Become familiarized with 3D software interface and terminology.
2. Use modeling workflows to create high quality topology and edge flow.
3. Perform fundamental polygonal modeling operations including mirror, extrude, loop cut, and subdivide.

## Instructions

**Note:** You should have a basic understanding of Blender's interface before completing this exercise. You should also complete the exercise called **Modeling the Airline Chair** prior to completing this exercise. 

1. Duplicate the modeling folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
    - If you were unable to produce a polygonal model, you can download the Airline Chair Model, and use it to complete the assignment.
2. Follow the video demonstration to create UV maps to texture the [KEM Weber Airline Chair](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/404536651/images/).
3. Apply the scale transform to reset each polygonal object.
4. Unwrap the chair’s parts’ UVs using the various methods and tools described in the tutorials.
5. Export a UV map for each part and save it in the project folder as **_uv-arm.jpg_**, **_uv-cushion.jpg_**_,_ etc.
6. Import the UV maps into Photoshop and create textures to match the Airline Chair as closely as possible.
7. Save the textures as **_arm\_color.jpg_**, **_cushion1\_color.jpg_**, etc. in the project folder. Name the files in an organized in a logical way.
8. In Blender, set up the chair’s textures so they are visible on the model.
9. Save the 3D scene file as **_LASTNAME_-texturing-chair** in the project folder.
10. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-texturing-chair.zip.**
11. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
12. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
