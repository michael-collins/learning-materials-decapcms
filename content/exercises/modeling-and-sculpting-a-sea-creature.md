## Learning Objectives

1. Become familiarized with 3D sculpting tools and terminology.
2. Use sculpting tools and workflows to create high resolution sculpt and retopology workflows to create a base mesh.

## Instructions

1. Watch the tutorials related to sculpting.
2. Create a project folder
3. Find reference images online for your subject and save them to project folder.
4. Use the techniques learned to create a detailed sculpt of an **aquatic sea creature**.
5. Create a second model by retopologizing the sculpt to create a low poly base mesh.
    - You should have two models: Hi-res sculpt and a low poly base mesh model
6. Save your blend file in a project folder `YOURNAME-sculpting.blend`.
7. Compress the folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `YOURNAME-sculpting.zip`_._
8. Upload the `.zip` file to the assignment dropbox.
