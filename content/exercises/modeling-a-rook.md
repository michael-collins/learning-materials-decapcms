## Learning Objectives

1. Practice working from reference images
2. Practice using 3D software interface and terminology.
3. Use modeling workflows to create high quality topology and edge flow.
4. Familiarize yourself with a cumulative number of hotkeys and operations (it's a good idea to keep a personal log of hotkeys and operators that you will likely use again, as you go).

## Instructions

For this assignment, recreate the steps in either of the two **demonstrations and submit your model to _Canvas and Open Studio for review._** You can begin either version with the same reference images, linked on this page.
