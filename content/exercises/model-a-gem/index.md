## Learning Objectives

1. Practice using 3D software interface and terminology.
2. Use modeling workflows to create high quality topology and edge flow.
3. Familiarize yourself with a cumulative number of hotkeys and operations (it's a good idea to keep a personal log of hotkeys and operators that you will likely use again, as you go).

## Instructions
