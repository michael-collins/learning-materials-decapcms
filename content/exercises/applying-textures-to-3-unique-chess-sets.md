## Learning Objectives

1. Practice using texture images and the UV editor
2. Short introduction to material nodes
3. Practice appending objects and importing containers into different blender files

## Instructions

**This week we will begin adding textures and potentially materials to our chess sets**
<br>
<br>  
The following videos use a texture image found freely linked on this page.
Additional. Texture images can be acquired for free from various online sources. Here is a possible source: [https://freepbr.com/ (Links to an external site.)](https://freepbr.com/)
<br>
<br>  
**The playlist videos for this week demonstrate:**
<br>
• How to append / combine objects to a common blender file
<br>
• How to apply and manipulate textures on objects. I have included older videos that go over how to apply textures to some individual objects. These are considered additional viewing, in case they are helpful.
<br>
• Blender nodes are introduced in a practical manner, to demonstrate how textures can be used alongside materials.
<br>
<br>  
**For this assignment, you will submit 9 total images.**
<br>  
Create three unique chess sets based on the steps in Demonstrations 1, 2 and tutorials. 
<br>  
**Submit three renders of each set to both _Canvas_ _and the corresponding discussion thread for review_.** 
<br>  Make sure that your assignment is titled in the following format:
**Last name, First name,** the word **"Lesson"** followed by the **Lesson number,** and the **word "Assignment"** followed by the **Assignment number.**
<br>  
**Example:** Brill Ian Lesson x Assignment x
