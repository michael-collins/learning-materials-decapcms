## Learning Objectives

1. Practice using 3D software interface and terminology.
2. Use modeling workflows to create high quality topology and edge flow.
3. Familiarize yourself with a cumulative number of hotkeys and operations (it's a good idea to keep a personal log of hotkeys and operators that you will likely use again, as you go).

## Instructions

Welcome to the **Blender 3D -Modeling Environment**.
<br>
<br>  
I provided a playlist of several different versions of the demonstration for this assignment. I recommend checking out the two most recent ones to see a variety of different approached that might be used.
<br>
<br>  
For this assignment, create 3 unique snowflakes, based on the steps in the demonstration and submit 3 images (from good angles) of your model to Canvas and the **corresponding discussion thread** for review. Make sure that your assignment is titled in the following format:
<br>
<br>  
Last name, First name, the word "Lesson" followed by the Lesson number, and the word "Assignment" followed by the Assignment number.
<br>
<br>  
Example:
Brill Ian Lesson x Assignment x
<br>
<br>  
Be sure to provide screen grabs or renders from 3 angles and the original blender file. Be sure to upload each file independently to facilitate ease in grading (so that the reviewer only need to download files when necessary).
