In this exercise, you continue working on the sea creature. You will practice unwrapping UVs, exporting a UV map, and creating textures in 2D image editing software like Substance Painter and/or Photoshop.

## Learning Objectives

1. Become familiarized with 3D software interface and terminology.
2. Use texturing workflows to add color and texture to your polygonal models.
3. Perform fundamental UV unwrapping operations including UV unwrap, mark seams, and project from view.

## Instructions

1. Watch the tutorials in Learning Resources.
2. Continue working from your model.
3. Duplicate the sculpting assignment folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
4. If you have not done so, retopologize the mesh.
    1. Export the high-poly version of the mesh as FBX format (this is the non-optimized high-resolution mesh used for generating a normal map.)
    2. Export the retopologized low-poly version of the mesh as FBX format. (You will use the normal map baked from the other mesh)
5. Use Adobe Substance painter to create textures like the following.
    1. BaseColor (Required)
    2. Height
    3. Roughness (Required)
    4. Metallic
    5. Normal (Required)
    6. Emissive
    7. Opacity
6. In Blender, set up the textures so they are visible on the model. You do not need to render an image.
7. Save the 3D scene file as `LASTNAME-texturing-creature` in the project folder.
8. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `LASTNAME-texturing-creature.zip`.
9. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
10. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
