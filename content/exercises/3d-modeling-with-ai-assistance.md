This exercise explores using AI tools for conceptual development in 3D modeling workflows.

## Learning Objectives

1. Use AI tools ethically for research and concept development
2. Create 3D models based on AI-generated concepts
3. Develop critical thinking about appropriate AI usage in creative work

## Instructions

1. **Research Phase**
   - Use AI tools to explore concept ideas
   - Generate reference images for inspiration
   - Research similar objects and designs
   
2. **Concept Development**
   - Create a mood board with AI-generated references
   - Document your design decisions
   
3. **Modeling Phase**
   - Create your 3D model in Blender
   - Focus on translating concepts into geometry
   - Apply textures and materials

4. **Documentation**
   - Document which AI tools you used and how
   - Explain how AI helped your conceptual development
   - Show your original work vs. AI references

## Deliverables

1. Blender file (.blend)
2. Rendered images (1920x1080)
3. Process documentation showing AI usage
4. Reflection on how AI influenced your design
