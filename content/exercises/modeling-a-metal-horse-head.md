## Learning Objectives

1. Practice working from reference images
2. Practice using 3D software interface and terminology.
3. Use modeling workflows to create high quality topology and edge flow.
4. Familiarize yourself with a cumulative number of hotkeys and operations (it's a good idea to keep a personal log of hotkeys and operators that you will likely use again, as you go).

## Instructions

This a demonstration of how to create a more complex Knight-like form that approximates a work by the artist, William Kofmehl III. You can download and use the attached reference images to complete this version of the Knight Chess Piece assignment.
