::sketchfab-component{src="https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/haus-eea4fe4f1424485182c56e64be90829c" title="Haus" height="600px"}
::

## Example 2: Uploaded GLTF File (Placeholder)

Once you upload a .glb or .gltf file, you can reference it like this:

::threed-viewer-component{src="/uploads/boxes-sculpt-1.glb" title="Box Sculpture"}
::
