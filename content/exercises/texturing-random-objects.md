In this exercise, you will continue working on your objects. Practice unwrapping UVs, exporting UV maps, and create textures in 2D image editing software like Photoshop.

## Learning Objectives

1. Become familiarized with 3D software interface and terminology.
2. Use texturing workflows to add color and texture to your polygonal models.
3. Perform fundamental UV unwrapping operations including UV unwrap, mark seams, and project from view.

## Instructions

1. Watch the tutorials in Learning Resources.
2. Duplicate the modeling folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
3. Apply the scale transform to reset each polygonal object.
4. Unwrap the objects’ UVs using the various methods and tools described in the tutorials.
5. Export a UV map for each of the three objects and save it in the project folder as `uv-object-1.png`, `uv-object-2.png`, and `uv-object-3.png`. If you have more than one UV map per object, use a logical naming scheme.
6. Import the UV maps into Photoshop and create textures.
    - Alternatively, you may use Blender’s internal texturing tools and workflow, or use Substance Painter! Have at it.
7. Save the textures as `object1-color.png`, `object2-color.png`, and `object3-color.png`, etc. in the project folder.
8. In Blender, set up the textures so they are visible on the model.
9. Save the 3D scene file as` LASTNAME-texturing-objects` in the project folder.
10. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `LASTNAME-texturing-objects.zip`.
11. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
12. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your `.zip` file can be downloaded and opened.
