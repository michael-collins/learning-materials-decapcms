## Learning Objectives

1. Practice keyframe animation of translation, rotation, and scale properties.
2. Become familiarized with keyframe animation.
3. Apply principles of animation

## Instructions

1. Watch linked tutorials in Learning Resources to get acquainted with animation tools.
2. Create a project folder on your computer and save a new `.blend` file called `LASTNAME-ball-bounce.blend`.
3. Follow the video demonstrations to animate a bouncing ball.
    - The duration of the animation should be at least 31 frames.
    - Download and use the provided ball bounce reference image.
    - Create a 9" sphere and apply the scale (**CTRL**+**A ⟶ Apply Scale**).
    - Following the reference, create an animation either by keyframing each frame or by using a motion path. Either technique will be accepted.
    - Add squash and stretch to the sphere.
4. Export a rendered video.
    - To create a video file, save the file and set the render settings output folder to the project folder.
    - Under **File Format**, choose **FFMpeg Video**, change the encoding format to **MPEG-4**
    - Under **Codec,** choose **H.264**.
    - Choose **Render** ⟶ **Render Animation** to create the animation file.
5. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `LASTNAME-`ball-bounce`.zip`.
6. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
7. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
