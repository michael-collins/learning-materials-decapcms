## Learning Objectives

1. Practice setting up Inverse Kinematics (IK) bone constraints.
2. Practice modeling to good edge flow for deformation.
3. Become familiarized with creating and binding an armature using the Rigify add-on.
4. Become familiarized with vertex weight painting workflows
5. Practice keyframe animation

## Instructions

1. Watch the tutorials.
2. Create a polygonal model a quadruped (four-footed animal) from scratch. I suggest a variation of a cat or dog.
3. Use the Rigify add-on to add an animal rig.
4. Adjust and paint vertex weights to create pleasing deformation as needed.
5. Create an animated walk cycle for the animal. Please use an animation reference video or a key pose guide image.
6. Set up a camera to frame the shot.
7. To create a video of the viewport’s animation, save the file and set the render settings output folder to the project folder. Under **File Format**, choose **FFMpeg Video**, change the encoding format to **MPEG-4**.
8. Choose **View** ⟶ **Viewport Render Animation** to create the animation.
9. Save as `LASTNAME-animal-rig-animation.zip` and upload to the submission dropbox.
10. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened. This should include:
    - `.blend` file
    - `.mp4` video file
