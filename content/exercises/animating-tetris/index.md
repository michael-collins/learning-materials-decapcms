## Learning Objectives

1. Practice applying the 12 principles of animation
2. Practice keyframe animation of translation, rotation, and scale properties.
3. Practice applying camera effects.

## Instructions

1. Watch the animation tutorials.
2. Create an animated scene inspired by [Tetris](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qIAAmaS9n0Q). It must include the following:
    - At least 8 moving pieces
    - Camera movement
    - Easing applied to keyframes of moving objects (non-linear tangents in graph editor)
    - Camera shake
    - At least 10 seconds of animation at 24 frames per second (240 frames)
3. To create a “playblast” animation, you can capture the animation directly from the viewport. To create a video of the viewport’s animation, save the `.blend` file and set the render settings output folder to the project folder. Under **File Format**, choose **FFMpeg Video**, change the encoding format to **MPEG-4**.
4. Choose **View** ⟶ **Viewport Render Animation** to create the animation file. Check that the animation file was created.
5. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `LASTNAME-tetris.zip`.
6. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
7. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
