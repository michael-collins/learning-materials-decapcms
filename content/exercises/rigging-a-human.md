## Learning Objectives

1. Practice setting up Inverse Kinematics (IK) bone constraints.
2. Practice modeling to good edge flow for deformation.
3. Become familiarized with creating and binding an armature using the Rigify add-on.
4. Become familiarized with vertex weight painting workflows
5. Practice keyframe animation

## Instructions

1. Watch the tutorials.
2. Create a polygonal model a human-like character from scratch (two arms, two legs, and a head). You may use a model you've previously created if you wish.
3. Use the Rigify add-on to add a human rig.
4. Bind the character model to the rig.
5. Adjust and paint vertex weights to create pleasing deformation as needed.
6. Create an animated walk cycle for the character. (Do not use Mixamo or download a pre-made animation)
7. Set up a camera to frame the shot.
8. To create a video of the viewport’s animation, save the file and set the render settings output folder to the project folder. Under **File Format**, choose **FFMpeg Video**, change the encoding format to **MPEG-4**.
9. Choose **View** ⟶ **Viewport Render Animation** to create the animation.
10. Save as `LASTNAME-human-rig-animation.zip` and upload to the submission dropbox.
11. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened. This should include:
    - `.blend` file
    - `.mp4` video file
