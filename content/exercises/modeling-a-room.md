## Learning Objectives

1. Become familiarized with 3D software terminology
2. Practice polygonal modeling workflows
3. Perform fundamental polygonal modeling operations including extrude, merge, bridge, and bevel.

## Instructions

**Note:** There are no step-by-step tutorials for this intermediate level exercise. See beginner level exercises if you need guided instruction.

1. Watch the video playlist for relevant workflows and techniques to adapt for this exercise.
2. Create a project folder. Save all assets to the project folder.
3. Model a room in your home as a diorama.
    - The room should have only two walls to make it easier to render.
    - Model a minimum of 5 unique objects or features in the room. The models can be simple and can have relatively low poly counts.
    - Focus ONLY on modeling, you will add textures in a later exercise.
4. If you are unsure about how to proceed with modeling any of the objects, try searching tutorial resources. Reach out to your instructor with any workflow questions.
    - Focus on maintaining quads and good [edgeflow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lip59doQQRk).
5. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `YOURNAME-modeling-room.zip`.
6. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
7. Ensure you’ve completed and included everything according to the instructions.
