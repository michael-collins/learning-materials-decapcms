2. Follow the tutorials to add NPR shaders to your creature and the environment.
3. Create shaders, materials, and freestyle lines to create a manga or comic book visual style.
4. Choose an interesting composition.
5. Use the compositing system in Blender to use blending modes and post-effects to enhance the visual quality as seen in the tutorials.
6. Save a 1920x1080 render as LASTNAME-npr-creature.png in the project folder.
7. Save your file as `LASTNAME-npr-creature.blend` in the project folder.
8. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `LASTNAME-npr-creature.zip`.
