## Learning Objectives

1. Practice working from reference images
2. Practice using 3D software interface and terminology.
3. Use modeling workflows to create high quality topology and edge flow.
4. Familiarize yourself with a cumulative number of hotkeys and operations (it's a good idea to keep a personal log of hotkeys and operators that you will likely use again, as you go).

## Instructions

Using the two shared reference images, recreate the steps in the **Demonstration** and **submit three renders to both _Canvas_ _and the corresponding discussion thread for review_**.
