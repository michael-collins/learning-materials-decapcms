## Learning Objectives

1. Practice configuring render settings to create a high quality render in Blender.
2. Practice setting up normal and specular maps to increase the realism for principled rendering.
3. Gain familiarity with adding depth of field effects to renders
4. Understand how to set up 3-point studio lighting

## Instructions

1. Watch the tutorials in Learning Resources.
2. Duplicate the modeling folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
3. Create a 3-point lighting setup.
4. Create a backdrop to out render each object. If you would like to reuse the backdrop, you can choose **File** → **Append** and choose the Blend file with the backdrop. Navigate through the folders to find the backdrop object to import bring it into the project file.
5. Create a new camera. Configure this camera as the render camera and adjust the focal length and **depth of field** settings.
6. Rendering using **Cycles** and high **sample** settings (500+) with **adaptive sampling** enabled.
7. Save the renders as `object1-render.png`, `object2-render.png`, and `object3-render.png`, etc. in the project folder. One render of each object is all that is required.
8. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `LASTNAME-render-objects.zip`**.**
9. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
10. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your `.zip` file can be downloaded and opened.
