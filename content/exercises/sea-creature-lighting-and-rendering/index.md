## Learning Objectives

1. Become familiarized with 3D software interface and terminology.
2. Use lighting and rendering workflows and tools to create an underwater scene.

## Instructions

1. Watch the tutorials in Learning Resources.
2. Continue working from your model.
3. Duplicate the sculpting assignment folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
4. Render the scene using Cycles renderer. Ensure you are using an appropriate version of Blender
    1. Murky water: Set up lights within volumes
    2. Caustics: Use shaders to fake caustic patterns
    3. Create a water surface
5. Render three images, each 1920 x 1080 or larger
    1. **Image 1:** Wide angle Field of View
    2. **Image 2:** Portrait Field of View
    3. **Image 3:** Telephoto Field of View
6. Save the 3D scene file as `LASTNAME-rendering-creature` in the project folder.
7. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `LASTNAME-rendering-creature.zip`.
8. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
9. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
