## Learning Objectives

1. Practice working from reference images
2. Practice using 3D software interface and terminology.
3. Use modeling workflows to create high quality topology and edge flow.
4. Familiarize yourself with a cumulative number of hotkeys and operations (it's a good idea to keep a personal log of hotkeys and operators that you will likely use again, as you go).

## Instructions

This is the most basic of four demonstrations on how to complete the Knight assignment. 
If you complete this version you will receive full credit for this week's requirement to create a Knight for you Chess Set
However, you are expected to watch all three demonstrations.
