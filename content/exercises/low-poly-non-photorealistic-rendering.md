2. Learn the character modeling workflow

## Instructions

2. Watch the tutorials.
3. Create greasepencil modifier, shaders, materials, and freestyle lines to create a manga or comic book visual style.
4. Save a 1920x1080 render as `LASTNAME-npr-character.png` in the project folder.
5. Save your file as `LASTNAME-npr-character.blend` in the project folder.
6. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it `LASTNAME-npr-character.zip`.
