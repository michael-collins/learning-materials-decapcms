## Instructions

This week I want you to make a low poly animal. Ideally, you will have more than one reference image. Below is a demonstration of how I would approach resolving a low poly model with only a profile image. For your assignment I encourage you to work from multiple reference images instead. However, some of the techniques I use to calculate volume and resolve topological flow may be of help. There is an additional video in the playlist that demonstrates the use of particles as a means of generating feathers on my Ostrich.

## Learning Objectives

1. Use 2D Reference images, imagination and observations / calculations to generate a basic 3D form of an animal. Use a combination of modeling techniques, HDRIs (free from https://polyhaven.com/hdris), or particles to create an environment for your animal
