In this exercise, you will practice polygonal modeling fundamentals and will use 3D software to build a polygonal model of the 1930s Kem Weber Airline Chair.

## Learning Objectives

1. Practice using 3D software interface and terminology.
2. Use modeling workflows to create high quality topology and edge flow.
3. Demonstrate understanding of fundamental polygonal modeling operations including mirror, extrude, loop cut, and subdivide.

## Instructions

**Note:** You should have a basic understanding Blender's interface to complete this exercise.

1. Create a folder on your computer. **This will be your project folder.** Save all files to this folder.
2. Follow the six-part video demonstration to model the [KEM Weber Airline Chair](https://collection.cooperhewitt.org/objects/404536651/images/). Skills to practice include:
    - polygonal edge flow
    - extruding polygon faces
    - inserting edge loops
    - moving, rotating, and scaling vertices, edges, and faces
    - mirroring and duplicating geometry
3. Clean up your [edge flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lip59doQQRk).
4. Save the 3D scene file as ‘**_LASTNAME_-modeling-chair.blend’** (I.E. – _collins_-modeling-b1.blend) in the project folder.
5. Compress the project folder once you’ve completed the tutorial and rename it **_LASTNAME_-modeling-chair.zip.**
6. Upload the .zip file to the assignment dropbox.
7. Double check that you’ve included all files and that your .zip file can be downloaded and opened.
