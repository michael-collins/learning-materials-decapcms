For this project, you will produce 3D rendered images of products and other objects you experience every day, but with one slight difference. You will augment the object in such a way to inhibit its utility, material qualities, or its system or environmental context.
<br><br>
To explore these concepts, we delve into the philosophical realm of objects and their existence, considering how we interact with them in both a functional and perceptual sense. **_[Ontology](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ontology)_**, the study of being, invites us to question not just what objects _are_ but _how_ they are—how they exist independently of human utility and purpose. By distorting or modifying the object, you are encouraged to explore the essence of its being outside of the roles assigned to it by human need or desire.
<br><br>
We will also touch on the concept of hyper-objects—entities that transcend our immediate comprehension and experience, such as climate change or the internet. These phenomena challenge our usual boundaries of time, space, and perception. As you alter your chosen object, consider whether it can become something more than a mere item of daily use. Can its altered form push it into a new realm of being, perhaps even taking on characteristics of a hyper-object that defies easy understanding?

1. **[Anthony Dunne & Fiona Raby - _Speculative Everything: Design, Fiction, and Social Dreaming_](http://ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=672907&site=ehost-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_Cover) (2013):** Dunne and Raby explore the use of speculative design as a tool for reimagining objects and systems. This book will help you think critically about how design can question the status quo and offer alternative realities, which aligns with the idea of augmenting objects to alter their utility and context.
2. **[Joseph Bedford - Is There an Object Oriented Architecture? : Engaging Graham Harman](http://ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/login?url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=nlebk&AN=2332813&site=ehost-live&scope=site&ebv=EB&ppid=pp_15) (2020):** Harman's work is central to Object-Oriented Ontology (OOO), a branch of metaphysics that explores the independence of objects from human perception. This book provides a foundational understanding of how objects interact with one another outside of human intervention.
3. **[Timothy Morton - _Hyperobjects: Philosophy and Ecology after the End of the World_](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/pensu/detail.action?docID=1477347) (2013):** Morton introduces the concept of hyper-objects, entities that are massively distributed in time and space. His work helps us understand how objects might exist beyond immediate human comprehension, providing insight into the philosophical underpinnings of your project.
4. **[Jane Bennett - _Vibrant Matter: A Political Ecology of Things_](https://www-jstor-org.ezaccess.libraries.psu.edu/stable/j.ctv111jh6w.2) (2010):** Bennett’s work on new materialism discusses the vitality of objects and their ability to act independently of human agency. This text expands on the idea that objects possess their own agency and liveliness.
5. **[Ian Bogost - _Alien Phenomenology, or What It’s Like to Be a Thing_](https://carbonfarm.us/555/bogost-ontography.pdf) (2012):** This book explores the speculative philosophy of objects and offers a more accessible take on object-oriented thought, pushing you to think about objects beyond human-centered perspectives.


## Learning Objectives

1. Demonstrate understanding of modeling, texturing, lighting and rendering using 3D software.
2. Practice creative problem solving and visual storytelling skills.
3. Explore ideas of material, form, and ontology through creative image production.
4. Engage with conceptual questions related to the 'object' through a short work statement. (Your writing should be specific to your work, and not be generated via AI tools)

## Requirements

**Pre-viz:** 
1. **Sketches (.jpg or .png):** label, and write ideas in physical/digital sketchbook.
    - Fill 3 to 5 pages of your sketchbook with project ideas. You may also work digitally if you prefer an all digital workflow, in which case, sketch the equivalent of 3 to 5 pages of a paper sketchbook.
    - Upload `jpg` or `png` images of sketchbook pages.
    - Must be clearly scanned or photographed. This should look professional, do not upload blurry, rotated, poorly cropped images.
2. **Reference sheet (.jpg or .png):** Find reference images and put them into a large image canvas. [See example](https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-4Yut0Kf3RvM/VsMZtsN8XaI/AAAAAAAABLs/vHE3iQ7FtLw/s1600/Roman_Times_Moodboard_.jpg) of mood board. Save as a single image.
    - You can use [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/), Photoshop, [Mural.co](https://www.mural.co/), or similar tools.
    - Submit references as a combined image as a `png` or `jpg`
3. **Work intent (.doc):** Describe what you will be doing.
    - Include name and date
    - Short one sentence description of what you intend to make.
    - Upload this in an MS Word `doc` format.
<br><br>

**Production (.jpg or .png):**
1. Submit screenshots from Blender showing significant progress.
2. Post your screenshots to the **Project updates** discussion thread.
3. Meet with instructor if needed.
<br><br>

**Work Statement (.doc):**

A work statement is a clear articulation about what you’ve made. This is not a journal entry, where you might feel compelled to complain about problems you’ve had with software, or that it didn’t turn out how you wanted. Instead, imagine this is being printed in a magazine, or put on the side of a gallery. What do you want your viewers to come away with?
<br><br>

**Include the following to create a clear work statement:**
1. Your name and date
2. Title of your work
3. What did you create?
    - IE - “In this work, entitled _name-of-work_, I created images that depict …”
4. Why did you make it?
    - IE - “I created this work because I am interested in exploring …”
    - IE - “This project is a response to the idea that …”
5. What is the work about?
    - IE - “This work is primarily focused on …”
6. How is what you’ve said the work is about demonstrated in the work you made?
    - Include examples. Try to avoid generalized statements, show specific links.
    - IE - “You can see an example of this in the work where I have used … to reference …”
7. Were there any unexpected, interesting, or strange outcomes?
    - **Note:** This is not a question/answer assignment, skip this if you aren’t sure what to write.
8. Did you have any interesting moments where the projects theme helped you understand something new or from a new perspective?
    - **Note:** This is not a question/answer assignment, skip this if you aren’t sure what to write.

<br><br>
**Upload work (.zip):**
1. Images should be: 1920px by 1080px minimum. 
2. Upload final materials as a `LASTNAME-project1-files.zip` file
    1. Include final work statement
        - MS Word .doc format
        - 150 words minimum
    2. file name: `LASTNAME-project1-statement.doc`
    3. Include the media you created
3. Post your render(s) to the **Project discussion** discussion thread.
4. Participate in work critique with peers.




## Instructions

1. **Read** the project description and identify at least one of the listed readings to aid in the pre-viz research.
2. Review the project **requirements.**
3. **Review links** in Associated Material to see how artists and designers engage with related themes to the project.
4. Go through the **project development process** (_See downloads for diagram image_):
